Just easy experiment to see how the Brainfuck interpreter works. Added some more functionality, and also a trasnpiler that converts the code into C++.

Use like:
```
./tom.sh source.tom     #first transpiles to C++ and then compiles a binary with g++
```

Todo:
- add variables with a symbols map
- add arithmetic
- translate to assembly?
